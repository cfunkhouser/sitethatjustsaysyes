# A Site which just says "Yes."

Have you ever wanted a website that answers a question in a hilarious manner?
Something like, "Is Min too warm?" Well, now you can have one really fast.

Just add your own domain, and push this site to Heroku.

Needs just one env var setting:

`SITE_TITLE` - The title of the page to serve.
